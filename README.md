## Contrib Guidelines
* Please contribute with [OC](http://m.memegen.com/hyndzm.jpg) only no body likes copy/paste gangstas around, but if you think another site has already explained a section/technology better than you provide a link and add __attributions and references__ if necessary to external sites, it's nice when your work is recognized by others. We know its hard to write something new that explains something old, that is simpler and more clear so in some cases its better to make diagrams to explain yourself and try to explain the same concepts in a more interesting and fun way.
* Each user should make his contributions with his own account, for the same reason as above otherwise we won't be able to tell __who__ contributed with __what__.
* To contrib please use github issues and [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). For instance if you want to contrib to the documents of __Code of Conduct__ and __Topics__ you first should check if there is an [__issue__](https://github.com/stone-payments/dlp-best-practices/issues) about those topics, if there isn't you should create 2 separate issues, and explain on the body of the issue what contributions you want to make, the whole idea behind this is that if another employee wants to contribute to the same topic you both don't duplicate content and work on the same __fork__, so the __issues__ will be the communication method between the __committers__. Once you agree on how you will contribute either alone or with your colleagues you can create a fork from the repo, you and other committers of the same topic/document/subject have to use the same forked repository to make your changes, so you will need to agree who will be the "fork" responsible (and of course grant write permissions between yourself in your own fork).
* Once all your contributions are finished in your fork, you should send a Pull Request petition so the integrators can review it and merge it into the main repository of best practices.
* Don't forget to check if your contribution it's linked here in the [main index file](README.md) or in a parent section referenced here.
* [Here is](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) the markdown cheatsheet you can use to create your documents.
* Write in english please :), don't worry if everything is not perfect as we will continue improving this guidelines overtime as we find and implement new best practices.
* __VERY IMPORTANT__, add the images that you required to this repo in the *static* subfolder of each subsection, in this way we ensure no broken links will be ever created, avoid using external image links.
